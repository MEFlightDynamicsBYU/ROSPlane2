ROSplane is a basic fixed-wing autopilot build around ROS2 for use with the ROSflight autopilot. It is a continuation of the original [ROSplane](https://github.com/byu-magicc/rosplane) project. It is built according to the methods published in Small Unmanned Aircraft: Theory and Practice by Dr. Randy Beard and Dr. Tim McLain.
